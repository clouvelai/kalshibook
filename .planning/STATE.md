## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0 decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table with outcomes.

v1.1 decisions:
- Hand-written SDK over code generation (research consensus, 3 of 4 files reject generation)
- httpx + stdlib dataclasses (no Pydantic in SDK -- avoids version conflicts)
- Single KalshiBook class with sync=True flag (not separate AsyncKalshiBook)
- Replay abstractions (replay_orderbook, stream_trades) deferred to v1.2

### Pending Todos

1. **Subscribe to ticker WS channel for open interest data** (collector)
2. **Fetch Kalshi event candlesticks for untracked markets** (api)
3. **Pre-populate playground with real captured market data** (dashboard)

### Blockers/Concerns

- None active.
